RQ1. Step-by-Step Plan to Compare Classical and Bio-Inspired Neural Networks
1. Implement / import bio-inspired neural network models (e.g., Liquid Neural Networks, Neural Circuit Policies).
    todo until 8th of October
2. Implement / import classical neural network models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).
    todo until 8th of October
3. Select/create/prepare the datasets (synthetic, real-world: MNIST digits, time-series)
    todo: check Daniela & Mathias' paper with datasets in ANNEX
4. Train the models (save training time, model complexity, accuracy, and loss)
5. Evaluate the models: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and runtime.
6. Compare the performance metrics, runtimes, and model complexities.
