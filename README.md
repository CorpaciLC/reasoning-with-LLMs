# Research Questions
## RQ1. Step-by-Step Plan to Compare Classical and Bio-Inspired Neural Networks
1. bio-inspired neural network models
       e.g., Liquid Neural Networks (LTCs), Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs)
3. classical neural network models
   update: RNNs done
   todo: CNNs
5. datasets (synthetic, real-world: MNIST digits, time-series)
    update: synthetic + noise done
    todo: check Daniela & Mathias' paper with datasets in ANNEX
6. train models (save training time, model complexity, accuracy, and loss)
7. evaluate: loss, accuracy, runtime
8. compare metrics, runtimes, and model complexities

## RQ2. Step-by-Step plan to mesure LLM interpretability/explainability/reasoning of the models
1. LLM models (e.g. llamas)
    todo until 15th of November
2. ...

## RQ3. Variation of input representation
    ...
