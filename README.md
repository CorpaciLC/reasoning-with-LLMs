# Research Questions
## RQ1. Step-by-Step Plan to Compare Classical and Bio-Inspired Neural Networks
1. Implement / import bio-inspired neural network models (e.g., Liquid Neural Networks, Neural Circuit Policies).
    todo until 8th of October
    update: done
2. Implement / import classical neural network models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).
    todo until 8th of October
    update: RNNs done, CNNs not yet
3. Select/create/prepare the datasets (synthetic, real-world: MNIST digits, time-series)
    todo: check Daniela & Mathias' paper with datasets in ANNEX
    update: work in progress
4. Train the models (save training time, model complexity, accuracy, and loss)
    update: work in progress
5. Evaluate the models: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and runtime.
    update: work in progress
6. Compare the performance metrics, runtimes, and model complexities.
    update: work in progress

## RQ2. Step-by-Step plan to mesure LLM interpretability/explainability/reasoning of the models
1. Select the LLMs to be analyzed (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, Llamas, etc.)
    todo until 15th of November
2. Select the datasets to be used for the analysis (e.g., time-series, human movement data, MNIST, etc.)
    todo until 15th of November
3. Train the LLMs on the selected datasets.
    todo until 1st of December
4. Evaluate the LLMs on the selected datasets.
    todo until 1st of December
5. Analyze the interpretability/explainability/reasoning of the LLMs.
    todo until 15th of December
6. Write thesis
